  zaggash/docker-murmur
```
**Parameters**

* `-p 64738:64738` - the port(s)
* `-v /etc/localtime` for timesync - *optional*
* `-v /config` - The config volume
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.


### Usage

The password is generated on first start.
It is written in the logs.
To show the logs of a container, you can execute the following command :

```
docker logs -f container_name
```

You can edit the config in the /config folder.
You need to restart the container to apply the change.
